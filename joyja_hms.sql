This requires daily monitoring of sugar levels and administration of insulin.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Type 2 diabetes</strong> also known as non-insulin dependent or adult onset is a result of the body\'s incapability of utilizing insulin. Over 95% of individuals with diabetes have this type. This sort of diabetes is generally the consequence of excess body weight and lack of physical activity.</p>\r\n<p>Side effects might be like those of type 1 diabetes however are frequently less observed. As a result, the illness might be discovered after several years of actual onset.</p>\r\n<h2>Can Diabetes be cured or reversed?</h2>\r\n<p>Diabetes sounds dangerous and frightening, but it does not mean a lifetime of medications, health complications, or injecting insulin. It is a kind of disease that can be controlled or can be completely reversed by adopting a healthy lifestyle and making a few healthy changes in your day-to-day routine.

Rich in fiber, they help in cleaning the intestines and maintaining diabetes.</li>\r\n<li>Dark green leafy vegetables.

For the initial 15-20 minutes of an exercise session, sugar level tends to increase in the body but it gradually lowers down later leading to maintaining the body&rsquo;s glucose level.</p>\r\n<p>If you make a habit of exercising daily for 30-45 minutes a day, you can also cut down the medication or insulin injections and gradually you will find that there is no need of taking medicines to maintain the blood sugar level. The only rule to this is consistency and discipline in maintaining the schedule.</p>\r\n<p>Aerobics is also a very good and fun activity you can opt for, which will help in lowering the diabetes level and will also be fun to perform. Moderate to vigorous intensity is advised for diabetic patients.</p>\r\n<p>Unstructured physical activities like walks and gardening also assist in weight management and decrease insulin resistance in the body.

Well, not getting the appropriate amount or quality sleep has multiple consequences on your body. The concept of sound sleep is always neglected and people nowadays tend to keep themselves awake till late at night and then go to work the next day without having enough sleep.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/AAlxTcoq8G4\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe><br><a title=\"Subscribe now to get the latest health-related information on our youtube channel.\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/proceedfit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Subscribe now to get the latest health-related information on our youtube channel.</em></a></p>\r\n<p>Lack of sleep may lead to the following problems<br>1. Drowsiness which may impede mental capability.<br>2. Learning disabilities in kids.<br>3. memory hindrance in people of all ages.<br>4. Behavioral changes.</p>\r\n<p>The above changes are not visible initially, but in long run cause gradual health depletion.&nbsp;<br>Sleep-deprived people in long run tend to develop lifestyle disorders such as obesity, diabetes, and various heart diseases. It does not stop at these, they also experience irritability and difficulty in making decisions. Thus, sleep impacts our lives in a major way and our mental and physical recovery strongly depends on the quality of sleep we have.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>Here are 5 simple tips to improve sleep quality</h2>\r\n<h2>1. Exercise and sports Activities.</h2>\r\n<p>According to a study conducted in 2016, it was exhibited that, twelve weeks of regular exercise increased sleep duration and sleep quality in youth. Regular physical activity shows significant improvement in the sleeping pattern of both men and women of all ages. Exercising in the morning definitely, plays a major role in enhancing the quality of sleep.&nbsp;<br>However, the time of day while performing exercise is an important factor. Exercising or playing some sport right before bed creates overstimulation in the body and prevents the person from falling asleep. A person should avoid physical activities too close to bedtime.</p>\r\n<p>Involving oneself in some sports activities promotes improved sleep quality and efficiency instead of delaying sleep span.</p>\r\n<h2>2. Avoid addictions, caffeine intake, Alcohol, and Nicotine.</h2>\r\n<p>Quality of sleep is badly affected by the amount of caffeine and nicotine intake. These are stimulants and they speed up the messages sent from brain to body and vice versa thus causing difficulty in sleeping. Alcohol, on breaking down inside the body has stimulating effects too.&nbsp;<br>Consuming alcohol, nicotine, and caffeine too close to bedtime should be avoided to prevent hampering the quality of sleep.</p>\r\n<p>Moreover, it is advised not to consume alcohol and nicotine or to stop these addictions as soon as possible for better health also, as they not only affect the sleeping quality and pattern but also deplete the quality of health leading to various respiratory and liver diseases.</p>\r\n<p>Additionally, consuming fluids an hour or so before bedtime should be avoided to reduce frequent trips to the washroom. Caffeine and alcohol both tend to increase the need to urinate frequently.</p>\r\n<h2>3. Healthy bedtime routine and a sleep schedule.</h2>\r\n<p>Talking about bedtime routine, one should establish a bedtime routine and should try to follow it every night before bedtime. It can be any light activity before bedtime like reading a book, slow walks in nature, or meditation. These practices have shown to improve the quality of sleep and reduce the time taken to fall asleep. The activities we do before bedtime have a significant impact on our sleeping patterns and quality.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>One should avoid using light emitting screens like smartphones, tablets, or laptops just before bedtime as it leads to longer sleep latency because of being exposed to blue light. The use of screens before bedtime creates sleep disturbances and performance depletion the next day.</p>\r\n<p>These activities vary from person to person and age to age. For a kid telling a bedtime story might help rather than making the kid read a book or do a meditation. But fixing a sleep routine would help in enhancing the quality of sleep.</p>\r\n<p>Sleep schedule is also very important. Proper hours should be set aside for sleep. For an average adult, the sleep schedule should be between 7 to 8 hours during nighttime. The amount of hours we sleep also regulates the working capacity of our minds. One more thing to keep in mind while fixing the schedule is the consistency of sleep cycles. Going to bed and getting up at the same time every day also improves the quality of sleep.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>4. Eating cycle and eating habits</h2>\r\n<p>What we eat and when we eat also affect our sleeping cycle. Going to bed stuffed or hungry should be avoided. Having a heavy meal just before bedtime, might create discomfort and will make it difficult to fall asleep.<br>Sugary snacks and beverages should be avoided before bedtime as they increase the energy level in the body. Alcohol, even if it makes a person feel drowsy at first disrupts sleep later, so consumption before bed of alcohol should be avoided.</p>\r\n<p>Foods like walnuts, pumpkins, lentils, broccoli, and soy help to increase sleep quality as they produce substances that help in getting good sleep.</p>\r\n<h2>5. Stop overthinking and worrying</h2>\r\n<p>Clearing your mind before bedtime is very important as overthinking makes it difficult to sleep. Avoid bringing the work life, bad memories, negative thoughts, and worries with you to your bed. A depressing mind impairs sleep. Mental relaxation is very important before bedtime for sound and quality sleep.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>One should avoid rumination, as it tends to create a negative mood. Avoid bringing thoughts of failures to your bed and sleep with a victorious mind. Don\'t be restless before bed as it will not only spoil the quality of sleep but will also create a negative energy circle for the next morning. It is observed that thoughts just before bed tend to have an effect on the next day\'s morning routine. Meditation can be fruitful in overcoming restlessness.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Yoga can also help in healing restlessness. Various yoga poses improve the quality parameters of sleep as they tend to reduce rapid eye movements and lead to dreamless restful sleep.</p>\r\n<p>If these tips are followed one can surely gain an advantage from them. Keeping oneself healthy, having peace of mind and quality sleep improves the overall quality of life we lead.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 8pt;\">Note : The information provided here is for general informational purposes only and is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

Intermittent fasting has proven to help reverse and prevent these health-related issues, as this restricts you from consuming calories for a long period of hours.</p>\r\n<p>The question that might be arising in your mind is whether we have to refrain from everything during the fasting window! A simple answer to this is &ldquo;No&rdquo;. Few drinks like calorie-free drinks, water, and coffee are allowed during the fasting window. Drinks with calories and solid food are not permitted.</p>\r\n<h3><strong>What are the various intermittent fasting methods?</strong></h3>\r\n<p>There are five popular patterns you can adopt as a part of intermittent fasting&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>1. &nbsp; &nbsp;Time-bound eating - It involves dividing the day into 2 slots. A very popular division is the 16/8 method featuring, 16 hours of fasting window and 8 hours of eating window. 8 hours eating window can be divided into 3 to 4 meals easily. 12/12 division is also followed by many people, especially beginners.</p>\r\n<p>2. &nbsp; &nbsp;The 5:2 diet- This method does not divide a day into slots but a week into eating and restricted eating window. It involves eating for 5 days of the week and for the remaining 2 days of the week, calorie is limited to just 500-600.</p>\r\n<p>3. &nbsp; &nbsp;Eat stop and eat pattern- It means fasting for continuous 24 hours once or twice a week.</p>\r\n<p>4. &nbsp; &nbsp;Alternate day method- This involves fasting every other day. Meaning, eating one day and fasting the next day.</p>\r\n<p>5. &nbsp; &nbsp;Warrior diet- This is among the popular methods of intermittent fasting. It means eating a small amount of raw vegetables and fruits during the day and having one large meal for dinner.</p>\r\n<h2>Let&rsquo;s discuss the Pros and Cons of intermittent fasting.</h2>\r\n<h3><strong>The Pros :</strong></h3>\r\n<p>Many health benefits have been linked with intermittent fasting. It has become part of a healthy life schedule, so well that the model has become ideal for a sustainable long-term diet. These are the few benefits intermittent fasting holds in it:</p>\r\n<p>1. &nbsp; &nbsp;Improved metabolic health and weight loss- Metabolic health and management of weight are the two main reasons for opting for intermittent fasting. Metabolic health shows how healthy our body internally. How well it maintains blood pressure, fat levels, and sugar levels in the body.</p>\r\n<p>2. &nbsp; &nbsp;Fasting creates a calorie deficiency in the body, thus maintaining weight and body burns that extra accumulated fat in the body to make energy. This accelerates the process of weight loss. It is a calorie-restricted diet that relies on limited daily calorie intake improvising the metabolic functionality of the body. The 16/8 method is directly contributing to weight loss.</p>\r\n<p>3. &nbsp; &nbsp;Suppressing feelings of hunger- Intermittent fasting being restrictive in nature, trains our body to eat less and feel less hungry more often. It increases the feeling of fullness and prevents munching every now and then.</p>\r\n<p>4. &nbsp; &nbsp;Simplified lifestyle- It helps in simplifying your day-to-day routine as you have to plan and cook fewer meals in your day. It provides you relief from counting your calories every now and then. You don&rsquo;t have to eliminate the food you enjoy from your diet, it is just you have to see when you are eating it.</p>\r\n<p>5. &nbsp; &nbsp;No need to buy a special diet- It is not about what you eat but about when you eat so you don&rsquo;t need to buy anything special to maintain your diet. It fits well in with the food you enjoy eating.</p>\r\n<p>6. &nbsp; &nbsp;Reduced inflammation- Intermittent fasting helps in calorie restriction which in turn reduces inflammation levels in the body.</p>\r\n<p>7. &nbsp; &nbsp;Lowering down the cholesterol level- According to a study, intermittent fasting also helps in managing and lowering the cholesterol level in the body. Low cholesterol level reduces the risk of heart disease and strokes.</p>\r\n<p>Apart from these, there are many other benefits of intermittent fasting like</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Boosting brain function</li>\r\n<li>Lowering blood pressure</li>\r\n<li>Reduced insulin resistant</li>\r\n<li>Active lifestyle</li>\r\n<li>Better sleep at night.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>Though intermittent fasting carries many benefits, it doesn&rsquo;t mean it has no cons with it.</p>\r\n<p>Benefiting many people, intermittent fasting may have certain downsides too. It may not the right choice for every person.</p>\r\n<h3><strong>The cons :&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n<p>A few of the cons are:</p>\r\n<p>1. &nbsp; &nbsp;Cravings- Because of being hungry for a long duration, tends to create an urge of hunger and cravings. When you reduce your calorie intake for a long period you experience hunger. In the initial days of fasting, cravings are more.If you are not disciplined with your fasting you can end up eating even more than you normally eat.</p>\r\n<p>2. &nbsp; &nbsp;Headaches- It is a very common side effect of intermittent fasting. Hunger gives rise to headaches and sometimes it becomes irritating. Headaches tend to occur because of caffeine withdrawal and low blood sugar during the fasting window.</p>\r\n<p>3. &nbsp; &nbsp;Digestion disturbances- Intermittent fasting can disturb your digestion. It can create many issues like constipation, diarrhea, and bloating. If consuming less water it can result in dehydration thus constipating your intestines. Choosing nutrient-rich food is very important while fasting.</p>\r\n<p>4. &nbsp; &nbsp;Mood swings- Increased hunger and cravings lead to more mood swings. Calorie restriction leads to anxiety and poor concentration. Self-control is very important in the case of intermittent fasting.</p>\r\n<p>Apart from these, there are many other possible side effects of intermittent fasting that might appear from person to person.</p>\r\n<p>These can be:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Sleep disturbances</li>\r\n<li>Bad breath</li>\r\n<li>Low energy</li>\r\n<li>Malnutrition</li>\r\n<li>Fatigue</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>A few more things to keep in mind while choosing intermittent fasting are:</p>\r\n<p>1) If you are a pregnant woman or if you are breastfeeding your child, avoid intermittent fasting or take medical advice.</p>\r\n<p>2) Young children are advised not to go for intermittent fasting.</p>\r\n<p>3)Those with a history of traumatic brain injury are not advised to opt for intermittent fasting.</p>\r\n<p>Before choosing intermittent fasting its important to understand your goals and take professional advice from a Nutritionist or your Doctor. Remember, it is not the only way to healthy and fit life; it is just one of the methods to adopt to bring discipline in your eating patterns.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 8pt;\">Note : The information provided here is for general informational purposes only and is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

However, &nbsp;it is important to remember that the symptoms should not be disregarded because prompt treatment can totally heal the patient.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>Factors and causes of anxiety</h2>\r\n<p>There are several elements that are known to affect the severity. &nbsp;Anxiety cannot be caused by a single factor. &nbsp;The causes of anxiety cases frequently interact with one another or work in unison.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>The following are contributing elements of anxiety disorders:</p>\r\n<p><br>&nbsp;<strong>1. Personality traits</strong><br>&nbsp;People who have anxiety problems constantly isolate themselves from other people because they see society as a dangerous place. &nbsp;The majority of people who suffer from severe anxiety have weak coping mechanisms and low self-esteem.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>2. Environment</strong><br>&nbsp;The environment also plays a role in the development of anxiety problems, &nbsp;a fact that many people are unaware of. &nbsp;A split from loved ones, &nbsp;financial difficulties, &nbsp;or other personal challenges concerning job or family life are examples of these situations.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>3. Brain complexity</strong><br>&nbsp;According to studies, &nbsp;certain imbalances and anomalies in a person\'s brain chemistry increase their risk of developing anxiety disorders. &nbsp;The majority of anxiety drugs on the market now aim to correct these chemical imbalances within the brain.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>&nbsp;4. Traumatic experiences</strong><br>&nbsp;Traumatic life events are also known to contribute to the development of anxiety. &nbsp;Traumatic life experiences include things like divorce, &nbsp;abuse, &nbsp;and death of a loved one. &nbsp;An individual might suffer great harm and depression as a result of traumatic events, &nbsp;which can lead to the emergence of anxiety disorders.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>5. Hereditary</strong><br>&nbsp;According to studies, &nbsp;anxiety problems are inherited. &nbsp;People with severe anxiety problems frequently have a history of mood disorders, &nbsp;drug misuse, &nbsp;and anxiety disorders. &nbsp;Anxiety problems are typically found in those who are also inherently sensitive to stress.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Let\'s now talk about some of the harmful physical effects that persistent anxiety may have. &nbsp;For instance, &nbsp;it might result in headaches, &nbsp;respiratory problems or shallow breathing, &nbsp;elevated blood pressure, &nbsp;idiopathic aches and pains, &nbsp;and overall fatigue. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Memory loss has also been related to chronic stress, &nbsp;particularly when it comes to short-term and spatial memory.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Insomnia :&nbsp;</strong> &nbsp;When you are always anxious, &nbsp;your mind is likely to be racing, &nbsp;keeping you up and unable to fall asleep. &nbsp;Your stress hormones are frequently amplified by anxiety, &nbsp;keeping your brain busy and wired even when you don\'t actually need to or want to be.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In order to achieve improved emotional well-being, &nbsp;there are several ways you might be capable of overcoming anxiety. &nbsp;You might try implementing the following strategies with the advice of your doctor.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3><strong>1)Nutrition</strong></h3>\r\n<p>According to research, &nbsp;the kind of meals and beverages you eat might affect your anxiety levels. &nbsp;According to one study, &nbsp;participants who drank more added sugar and saturated fat had higher levels of anxiety compared to those who consumed less of both.&nbsp;<br>Eating a diet high in fibre, &nbsp;fruits, &nbsp;veggies, &nbsp;and healthy fats, &nbsp;and low in processed foods is linked to better mood and easier management of mental illnesses including anxiety and depression. &nbsp;<br>Additionally, &nbsp;caffeine might make you feel more anxious. &nbsp; &nbsp;If you consume more than a single cup of coffee each day, &nbsp;consider reducing your intake or quitting entirely and see whether your anxiety decreases. &nbsp;Because there is caffeine in many teas, &nbsp;drinks, &nbsp;and foods (including chocolate), &nbsp;it\'s important to check nutrition labels and keep track of how much you\'re taking in.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>2) Physical Exercise</strong></p>\r\n<p>Find a method to exercise that feels good for you; it really doesn\'t have to be an exhausting, &nbsp;protracted workout. &nbsp;Even a little 10-minute walk may lift your spirits.&nbsp;<br>Exercise can help you focus better, &nbsp;sleep better, &nbsp;and feel less stressed. &nbsp;For patients with anxiety and depression, &nbsp;many doctors recommend physical activity in addition to counselling and/or medicine.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3><strong>3)Mindfulness</strong></h3>\r\n<p>You can also try practising mindfulness, &nbsp;meditating, &nbsp;breathing deeply, &nbsp;and progressive relaxation of muscles as additional coping mechanisms to assist reduce anxiety. &nbsp;According to one study, &nbsp;those who used the mindfulness meditation approach significantly reduced their levels of stress and anxiety.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3><strong>4)Be In Touch With Nature</strong></h3>\r\n<p>Another method to reduce anxiety is to get in touch with nature. &nbsp;Going for a walk in the park or even just listening to nature noises might help you feel more connected to nature and improve your mood, &nbsp;according to studies. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>Treatment</h2>\r\n<p>Along with other diseases including phobias, &nbsp;anxiety attacks, &nbsp;and social phobia may also be a sign of generalised anxiety disorder.&nbsp;<br>It\'s critical to understand that you\'re not alone: More than 30% of individuals may have an anxiety problem at some time in their life, &nbsp;making anxiety disorders one of the most prevalent mental health diseases.&nbsp;<br>It\'s critical to get treatment if anxiety is upsetting you or interfering with your daily activities. &nbsp;Typically, &nbsp;psychotherapy, &nbsp;medicine, &nbsp;or a mix of the two are used as anxiety treatments. &nbsp;Discussing your symptoms with your doctor will help you identify the best course of therapy for you.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Natural Supplements</strong><br>You could get relief from stress or anxiety with a natural supplement. &nbsp;You can consider herbal medicine like Amoryn or making small dietary adjustments. &nbsp;Studies using Amoryn, &nbsp; have demonstrated excellent outcomes for 90% of patients with depression and 88.6% of patients with anxiety. &nbsp;The innate ability for pleasure in the brain is increased by the natural antidepressant amoryn.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Another all-natural substance that reduces anxiety and panic episodes is seredyn, &nbsp;which also helps you feel calm and in control throughout the day.&nbsp;<br>These natural supplements frequently yield fruitful outcomes in a little amount of time and are typically not habit-forming. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>It might be challenging to come out of a vicious cycle caused by anxiety. &nbsp;Luckily, &nbsp;anxiety is easy to cure. &nbsp;Self-help techniques for overcoming anxiety can be beneficial, &nbsp;but it\'s also crucial to discuss your treatment choices with your doctor. &nbsp;You may keep in mind that your anxiety isn\'t preventing you from fulfilling your goals by taking action to improve.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 8pt;\">Note : The information provided here is for general informational purposes only and is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

Our body needs basic BMR (basal metabolic rate) to support these capabilities. Various factors that affect the BMR of our body are:<br>&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;Age<br>&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sex<br>&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;Muscle mass<br>&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;Physical activities<br>&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;Type of food you consume</p>\r\n<p>Food is an essential part of our life and a key factor for our survival. We require essential nutrients and, food is the primary source of such nutrients. These nutrients are converted to energy to perform the basic function of life like, &nbsp;breathing, digestion, growth, repairing, and building up the immune system. The process of conversion of energy is known as metabolism.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>Some of the essential nutrients for our overall growth are:</h3>\r\n<p>&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Carbohydrates </strong>- It is essential to keep the body moving and alive. This also builds up body fat.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Dietary fiber</strong> -&nbsp; It supports the absorption of nutrients in the body. It absorbs harmful chemicals and makes feces soft and easy to excrete. It helps prevent obesity</p>\r\n<p>&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Fats </strong>- It provides a concentrated source of energy and supports growth.</p>\r\n<p>&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Proteins</strong> - It builds up the immune system of the body. It is essential for building cells and antibodies.</p>\r\n<p>&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Water</strong> - It is essential for making the fluid content of the body. It has an important function in creating tears, sweat, and urine. It helps in breaking chemicals in the body.</p>\r\n<p>&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Iron</strong> - It is a key nutrient for building up hemoglobin. &nbsp;The protein in red blood cells regulates the transport of oxygen to every tissue of the body.</p>\r\n<p>&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Iodine</strong> - It is very much required for the formation of thyroid hormones. It is required in the development of the brain and nervous system.</p>\r\n<p>&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Vitamins</strong> - They are very important for making up the immune system of the body and the breakdown of harmful elements.</p>\r\n<p>&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Folate</strong> - It helps in the prevention of abnormalities in the fetus and helps in generating healthy blood.</p>\r\n<p>The bottom line is, food is the most essential element for metabolism.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>How well our metabolism rate decides how well our body is functioning. Food plays an important role in maintaining the metabolism rate of our body.</p>\r\n<h3><strong>So, what type of food is best for our metabolism?</strong></h3>\r\n<p>Here is the list of food items that are best for boosting the metabolism rate of our body:<br><strong>&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;Beans</strong><br><strong>&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;Legumes</strong><br><strong>&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;Green leafy vegetables</strong><br><strong>&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;Protein-rich food like meat, fish, nuts, seeds, etc.</strong><br><strong>&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;Tea</strong><br><strong>&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;Water &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</strong><br><strong>&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;Avocado</strong><br><strong>&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;Green tea</strong></p>\r\n<p>It is very important to understand the functionality of our metabolism and to know what upsets it.</p>\r\n<p>Not every food is good for metabolism. Various food items may ruin the metabolism function of our body. You are required to cut down on the consumption of these food items or level down the consumption for a better metabolism rate.</p>\r\n<p>Here is the list of various food items you should cut down on, or should avoid consumption of:<br>&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Refined grains </strong>- it spikes the blood sugar level and may create various health-related issues and heart conditions.<br>Refined grains have a high glycemic index and deficiency of fiber which slows down glucose metabolism in the body. Refined grains deteriorate insulin sensitivity.</p>\r\n<p>&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Alcohol</strong> - Alcohol is considered to be high in calories and it irritates our metabolism process. It is not good for the gastrointestinal tract. It tends to harm our blood sugar level.</p>\r\n<p>Alcohol creates an urge of eating sweets which also affects the functioning of the metabolism process in the body negatively.</p>\r\n<p>&bull; &nbsp; <strong>&nbsp;Wheat and refined wheat flour </strong>- They hold a high amount of gluten which slows down the metabolism of our body. Gluten is also known to spike blood sugar levels. It puts an inflammatory burden on the stomach, liver, and immune system of our body which tends to disturb the metabolism regulator of the body.</p>\r\n<p>Refined wheat flour has low nutritional value as compared to whole wheat flour.</p>\r\n<p>&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Sugar </strong>&ndash; though it treats our taste buds, it does not support our metabolism functioning if consumed in large amounts. It promotes inflammation in the body. It reduces fat metabolism in the body resulting in storing of more fat in the body.</p>\r\n<p>Sweet beverages should also be consumed in limited amount as it slows down metabolism and increases the sugar level. Drinks with a high amount of sugar in them increase the feeling of hunger.</p>\r\n<p>&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Refined starches </strong>- white rice and white bread lack fiber and nutritional elements. Instead of refined starches, you should opt for whole-grain meals.</p>\r\n<p>&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Omega-6 fats </strong>- Vegetable oil, chicken, etc contain omega-6 , if not portioned adequately can lead to inflammation. This type of fat if consumed in high quantity disturbs the metabolism of our body. To balance out omega-6 fat you should consume food rich in omega-3 fats.such fats are found in foods like corn, sunflower, mayonnaise, soy, and peanuts.</p>\r\n<p>&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Dairy </strong>- If you have lactose intolerance and you are consuming dairy then you are giving an open invitation to slow down your metabolism rate. If you have metabolic syndrome then also you are advised to cut down on dairy consumption or to find out substitutes for dairy and include them in the diet.</p>\r\n<p>&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Junk food </strong>- Junk food though very tasty and pleasing, takes a lot of energy and effort to digest. It slows down the metabolic functioning of the body. Junk food is full of refined starches and refined wheat flour. The added preservative in packed junked food is also very harmful to the body and tends to create inflammation.</p>\r\n<p>What we put into our system decides how well our body will function. So it is very important to look at the nutritional value of the food item before we consume it. After all, what we eat is reflected in our overall personality. It is best to consult a nutritionist or your doctor to know about the best options that fit your body type.</p>\r\n<p>Stay fit, eat healthy and keep your metabolism at its best.<br>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 8pt;\">Note : The information provided here is for general informational purposes only and is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

The nutritional value of food plays an active role in getting a healthy life. To maintain a healthy lifestyle it is crucial to understand what nutrition actually means!</p>\r\n<p>In the biological definition, Holozoic Nutrition means the biochemical and physiological cycle by which an organism utilizes food to help it to survive.</p>\r\n<p>Holozoic nutrition is a type of nutrition in which an organism obtains energy and nutrients by consuming other organisms or organic matter. This is the most common type of nutrition in animals.</p>\r\n<p>In holozoic nutrition, the organism takes in food through its mouth and breaks it down into smaller molecules using digestive enzymes. The smaller molecules are then absorbed into the bloodstream and used for energy or to build new tissues.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Better nutrition leads to various benefits such as:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>&nbsp; &nbsp;Improved infant, child, and maternal health<br>2. &nbsp; &nbsp;Strong Immune system<br>3. &nbsp; &nbsp;Safe pregnancy and childbirth<br>4. &nbsp; &nbsp;Less risk of diseases like diabetes and cardiovascular diseases<br>5. &nbsp; &nbsp;Better learning ability<br>6. &nbsp; &nbsp;Bone strengthening<br>7. &nbsp; &nbsp;Stronger digestive system<br>8. &nbsp; &nbsp;Longevity</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Type of nutrition</h2>\r\n<h3>Majorly nutrition are of the following types:</h3>\r\n<p>A. &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Autotrophic nutrition</strong> - The process of preparation of food from simple natural materials like water, carbon dioxide, and mineral salts in the presence of sunlight is called autotrophic nutrition.</p>\r\n<p>The word autotrophic itself explains its meaning i.e. auto-self and trophic-nutrition, which collectively means self-nutrition. Autotrophic organisms use a green-colored pigment called chlorophyll to prepare their food.</p>\r\n<p>B. &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Symbiotic nutrition </strong>- This type of nutrition happens as a result of the mutual association of organisms. Example fungi and lichens.</p>\r\n<p>This mutual association between organisms is for nutrition and shelter.</p>\r\n<p>C. &nbsp; &nbsp;Heterotrophic nutrition- The type of nutrition where organisms depend upon others for food and survival and cannot make their food. All animals, humans, and non-photosynthesizing plants fall under the category of heterotrophic organisms.</p>\r\n<h3>Heterotrophic nutrition is categorized into following types</h3>\r\n<p>1. &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Saprophytic nutrition </strong>- The type of nutrition where organisms feed on dead remains of other organisms for survival is called saprophytic nutrition.</p>\r\n<p>2. &nbsp; <strong>&nbsp;Parasitic nutrition </strong>- Obtaining food from the host that is, other living organisms is parasitic nutrition. The parasites survive by feeding on the blood of the host by living either inside or on the body of the host.</p>\r\n<p>3. &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Holozoic Nutrition </strong>- Engulfing the food into the body through the mouth, digesting it, and absorbing the nutrients and energy from the digested food is known as Holozoic nutrition.</p>\r\n<h2>Let&rsquo;s understand holozoic nutrition in detail</h2>\r\n<p>A type of heterotrophic nutrition described by the assimilation (ingestion) and internal processing of fluids or solid food particles is known as holozoic nutrition. This is a type of nutrition that occurs in the organisms that take food inside their body in the form of solids and liquids.</p>\r\n<p>This type of nutrition is exhibited in protozoa such as amoeba and by humans and most animals where food is taken in solid and liquid form and is further broken down to absorb nutrients.</p>\r\n<h3>Holozoic nutrition is a five-step process:</h3>\r\n<p>1. &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Ingestion </strong>- The process of taking food inside the body through the mouth is called ingestion. This can be done either by swallowing the food. It is also referred to as the initial step of digestion.</p>\r\n<p>Food is taken into the mouth where it is broken down by the teeth into more modest pieces. The presence of food in the mouth sets off a reaction that makes the salivary organs convey watery liquid called saliva to the mouth. Saliva plays the role in making food swallowable and it also helps in breaking down the food.</p>\r\n<p>2. &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Digestion </strong>- The ingested food mixed with saliva is digested with the help of various enzymes. It is the complicated course of transforming the food you eat into nutrients, which the body utilizes for energy, and cell repair for survival and growth. It also creates waste that is to be eliminated from the system.</p>\r\n<p>Digestion is the step that is responsible for the absorption of nutrients into the bloodstream. Digestion in humans occurs in the gastrointestinal tract.</p>\r\n<p>3. &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Absorption</strong> - The energy generated through the digestion of the food is used by the cells of the body. Absorption happens in the body through the following mechanism<br>a) &nbsp; &nbsp;Simple diffusion- Few monosaccharides like glucose, amino acids, etc after digestion diffuse into the blood. It can also be defined as the movement of these monosaccharides from a higher concentration to a lower concentration.</p>\r\n<p>b) &nbsp; &nbsp;Active transport.- Sodium ion electrolytes from the digested foods are actively transported to the blood through this mechanism.</p>\r\n<p>c) &nbsp; &nbsp;Facilitated transport.- In this process carrier proteins helps in the movement of solutes across the membrane.</p>\r\n<p>d) &nbsp; &nbsp;Passive transport.- Simpler food substances after digestion are absorbed into the blood through this process.</p>\r\n<p>4. &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Assimilation</strong>. - In this step, the energy that is being obtained from the digested food is being used by all the cells of the body. It is the process of retention of nutrients, minerals, and different compounds from food as a component of the nourishment of an organism.</p>\r\n<p>The liver plays an important role in the assimilation process. Amino acids obtained from digested foods are used in building up new proteins and fats are used to create energy.</p>\r\n<p>5. &nbsp; <strong>&nbsp;Egestion </strong>- The process of excreting out waste from the body is called egestion. The undigested food is removed from the body through the process of egestion.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>Pros and Cons of Holozoic Nutrition</h2>\r\n<h3>The pros of holozoic nutrition</h3>\r\n<p>a) &nbsp; &nbsp;It provides the proper nutrition required by bodies of heterotrophic organisms<br>b) &nbsp; &nbsp;It helps in the proper digestion of food inside the body<br>c) &nbsp; &nbsp;It helps in the generation of energy required by the body<br>d) &nbsp; &nbsp;It strengthens the immune system of the body</p>\r\n<h3>The cons of holozoic nutrition&nbsp;</h3>\r\n<p>a) &nbsp; &nbsp;Not every secretion from holozoic nutrition is good for small intestines<br>b) &nbsp; &nbsp;Excessive glucose secretion from digested food leads to increase the risk of chronic diseases like diabetes<br>c) &nbsp; &nbsp;Any disturbance in digestion can lead to inflammation in the body</p>\r\n<h2>Best Holozoic foods for humans&nbsp;</h2>\r\n<div class=\"flex-1 overflow-hidden\">\r\n<div class=\"react-scroll-to-bottom--css-jacoa-79elbk h-full dark:bg-gray-800\">\r\n<div class=\"react-scroll-to-bottom--css-jacoa-1n7m0yu\">\r\n<div class=\"flex flex-col items-center text-sm h-full dark:bg-gray-800\">\r\n<div class=\"w-full border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 group bg-gray-50 dark:bg-[#444654]\">\r\n<div class=\"text-base gap-6 m-auto md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-2xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0\">\r\n<div class=\"relative flex w-full flex-col lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]\">\r\n<div class=\"flex flex-col gap-3\">\r\n<div class=\"min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap\">\r\n<div class=\"markdown prose break-words dark:prose-invert light\">\r\n<p>Different foods provide different nutrients and have different effects on the body.

Tooth decay is the process that occurs overtime. There are the following reasons for tooth decay:-</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br>1. &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Plaque forms-</strong> It is a kind of clear sticky layer that covers your teeth. This happens because of eating too much of sugary items and starchy food and not cleaning the teeth well. If you don&rsquo;t clean your teeth well after eating sweet and sugary items, bacteria quickly start feeding on it and forms plaque.<br>Plaque on staying for long on your teeth starts to form tartar which makes it more difficult to clean the plaque off your teeth.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">2. &nbsp; <strong>&nbsp;Swollen gums and roots</strong>- As tooth rot creates bacteria and acid continues to destroy your teeth moving close to the internal tooth material (pulp). The pulp contains nerves and blood vessels. This leads to swollen pulp and gums. The tooth keeps on rotting and the pain can reach till the bone</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">3. &nbsp; <strong>&nbsp;Holes in the enamel-</strong> When the plaque accumulates on your teeth, its acid remove minerals from enamel. This leads to erosion and holes in enamels. This enamel holes are also known to be the initial stage of cavity.&nbsp;<br>If left untreated bacteria through these holes can reach the next layer of your tooth called dentin. Dentin is less resistant to acid and rots very fast. Dentin being in direct contact to nerve starts causing sensitivity.</p>\r\n<h2>How to avoid Tooth cavities?</h2>\r\n<p>As mentioned above also it is very important to maintain healthy teeth and to avoid tooth cavity.</p>\r\n<p>There are following ways you can opt for to avoid tooth cavity:</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brush with toothpaste containing fluoride- make a habit of brushing twice a day especially after your last meal. Use fluoride enriched toothpaste for cleaning the residue of your food from your teeth.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;Regular visits to dentist- Visit to your dentist at regular intervals helps in keeping teeth healthy. It also helps in early spotting of the problem in your teeth.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sealants- A sealant is a defensive plastic covering applied to the biting surface of back teeth. It helps in protecting enamel from plaque attack.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;Avoid sugary items- Too much consumption of sweet and sugary foods leads to creation of plaque. It accelerates the bacteria attack and acid creation that destroys enamel.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;Flossing- using floss to clean your teeth can help you getting rid of that stuck food particles between your teeth and preventing bacteria formation.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Apart from these few eating habits can also help in avoiding tooth cavity. Few changes you can make in your eating habits are:</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; padding-left: 40px;\">&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;Limit fruit juice consumption<br>&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;Limit your cookies, chocolates and candies consumption<br>&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;Limit sweet beverages<br>&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;Limit your snacking over junk food<br>&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;Avoid substances that dry your mouth.<br>&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;Avoid sticky food<br>&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;Avoid hard to crack food<br>&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;Stop consuming extremely hot or extremely cold food.<br>&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;Limit your wine consumption<br>&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;Limit coffee and tea consumption</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Remember a healthy tooth means healthy mouth and a healthy mouth means a beautiful smile.

(34, 11, 18, 'Foods to Unclog Arteries', 'Proceed.Fit', 'uploads/unclog_arteries.png', '', '<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Healthy and unclogged arteries are very important for the normal functioning of the heart and thereby whole body. It is one of the main components regulating blood circulation in the body. It is the major part of the blood circulatory system. It is a tube-like structure that transports fluids like blood &amp; lymph to and fro every part of the body.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Arteries are majorly responsible for the transportation of oxygen, hormones, and nutrients in our bodies.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Arteries are made out of smooth muscle permitting dilation and contraction through the parasympathetic nervous system.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Because the artery is responsible for carrying oxygenated blood from the heart to other parts of the body they need to have a clear and unclogged passage. Clear and unclogged passage helps in the proper flow of blood to and fro.</p>\r\n<h2>What are the reasons for clogged arteries?</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Too much cholesterol is a reason for many health complications. It is very important to manage cholesterol levels for a healthy and stress-free life. It is one of the major reasons responsible for clogged arteries.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Cholesterol gets accumulated on the walls of the arteries making the passage narrow and blocked. This blockage reduces the flow of blood through arteries and not every part of the body including the heart gets the proper amount of oxygenated blood.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Inflammation is also responsible for clogged arteries. This clogged artery situation is also known as Coronary artery disease or arterial plaque.</p>\r\n<h2>What happens if you have clogged arteries?</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When your artery is clogged and the passage for blood to travel is narrow your heart is unable to get enough oxygenated blood. This can lead to Angina (a situation of pain in the chest because of reduced blood flow to the heart) and uneasiness in breathing.</p>\r\n<p>If there is complete clogging in the arteries, it can lead to a heart attack.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>Signs and symptoms of clogged arteries.</h3>\r\n<p>Clogged arteries show the following symptoms in the body:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Crushing pain in the chest</li>\r\n<li>Pressure on chest</li>\r\n<li>Pain in arms and shoulders</li>\r\n<li>Shortness of breath</li>\r\n<li>Abnormal sweating</li>\r\n<li>Heart palpitations</li>\r\n<li>Neck pain</li>\r\n<li>Jaw pain</li>\r\n<li>Nausea</li>\r\n<li>Fatigue</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Can you unclog your clogged arteries?</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you have gone through tests and it shows that you are dealing with clogged arteries, don&rsquo;t panic. Panic will worsen the situation even more. Visit your doctor and ask for his guidance to help you out. You can also make efforts to improve your situation. You can opt for a lifestyle that will help you in clearing down the clogs and remove the blockage from arteries. Some of such lifestyle changes that you can make are:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Exercising and physical activities</li>\r\n<li>Stress management</li>\r\n<li>Dietary changes</li>\r\n<li>Management of sleeping cycles</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>How food helps in unclogging arteries?</h2>\r\n<p>Involving some foods in your diet can help in clearing up the blocked arteries.

The stress levels continue to rise until, one day, a major collapse of our health may awaken us to the fact that we have forgotten to care for one important thing&mdash;our health.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">People&rsquo;s susceptibility to diseases such as obesity, diabetes, heart attacks, and hypertension has increased as a result of an unhealthy lifestyle. This has resulted in grave consequences for the near future. As a result, it is critical that we prioritise our health alongside our work. Moderation in our eating habits, daily exercise, and a balanced work life can all make a significant difference in our health and body. When a person maintains his or her mental and physical fitness, his or her actions and decisions become more practical, logical, and efficient, and he or she is more successful in life. Furthermore, our personality is influenced by our physical health.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A physically or mentally Ill person faces numerous challenges in life, even if they rely on others for their basic needs. So it is beneficial to maintain good health, both physically and mentally, without the assistance of others. Wealth and health are correlated to each other. We need money to maintain good health, and we need good health to earn money. But it is also true that we can live without money, but we cannot live with unhealthy habits. A healthy state of mind and body helps us all the time and encourages us to do something better in our lives rather than just earn money.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There are many ways a person can improve his or her health without any assistance. These tips are issued by the World Health Organization (WHO) itself and are pretty reliable for achieving stable health.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">These tips are for everyone, regardless of age, and must be followed by everyone to&nbsp;improve their fitness and health.</h3>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Have a balanced diet</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In India, it is believed that what we eat is what we become. Eating healthy can cure chronic diseases like heart disease, tumours, strokes, and diabetes. It may also help you maintain a <a href=\"../blog_details.php?blog=30&amp;title=Foods-to-boost-metabolism-and-lose-weight\">healthy weight</a> and reduce your risk of developing certain cancers. A balanced diet includes the proper amount of calories, proteins, vitamins, and minerals. A well-balanced diet should also include bioactive products such as dietary fibre, antioxidants, and nutraceuticals, all of which have health benefits. The most crucial rule of healthy eating is that no meal should be skipped. Meal skipping lowers your metabolic rate. Normal eating consists of three main meals and two snacks in between. In addition, never skip breakfast. It is the most important meal of the day.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Exercise daily</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Exercising on a regular basis is important for maintaining a healthy state. Physical activity can improve your brain health, help you manage your weight, lower your risk of disease, strengthen your bones and muscles, and improve your ability to do everyday tasks. Adults who sit less and engage in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity reap health benefits. Regular exercise strengthens the cardiovascular system to deliver more oxygen to the body with each heartbeat and the pulmonary system to increase the efficiency of oxygen delivery to the body.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Prioritize your mental health</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Decrease stress in your daily life. Stress reduces mental activity and affects the normal metabolism of the body. Mental health is more important than ever. It affects every aspect of our lifestyles. Everything we do, think, or say is influenced by our mental health, which in turn influences our physique. Maintaining a healthy mental state and treating any mental health conditions are critical for restoring constructive behaviours, emotions, and thoughts. Focusing on mental health care can boost productivity, improve our self-image, and strengthen relationships.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Give up bad habits</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Smoking, tobacco, alcohol, and drugs are all harmful to your health. Smoking can harm the lungs because the smoker inhales nicotine as well as other chemicals. Cigarettes have been linked to an increased risk of developing lung cancer. Men are more at risk than women. Alcohol is the leading cause of liver diseases like cirrhosis and liver dysfunction. Dehydration-related effects, like nausea, headaches, and dizziness, come along with the side effects of alcohol. Drugs, on the other hand, directly attack mental health. Drugging can cause amnesia (loss of memory), alopecia (loss of hair), gastrointestinal issues, sedation, euphoria, bradycardia, bronchoconstriction, urinary retention, and the list goes on and on.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Overdoing anything is injurious to health</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Overeating, oversleeping, overthinking, and overdoing everything harm the health. Do things in moderation to get the best results for your health.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Improve sleep-wake cycles</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Good sleep is an extremely important aspect of our daily lives. Sleep has been extensively influences our quality of life in a variety of ways, including our behaviour, work efficiency, immunity, and mental health maintenance.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lessen the use of sugar and salt in food</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Sugar consumption increases the risk of tooth decay and overweight. Consuming more sugar can cause diabetes mellitus type 2. Sugar-free products are the best replacements for sugar. Salty foods can cause hypertension and heart problems with long-term usage.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Strengthen your immune system</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The immune system is the protector of our body. Each and every disease first affects the immune system before attacking any other system. Hence, developing and strengthening our first line of defence becomes crucial to surviving. Vaccinations, immunity supplements, and vitamins like vitamin C.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In conclusion, health is wealth, and without that wealth, no other wealth is worthy. Staying healthy is essential for living a happy life free of diseases. Furthermore, at this time, a large proportion of people are obese, which means they are overweight and unhealthy. A daily routine of fitness exercise and a healthy diet can increase your lifetime, and you can feel better just by applying these simple steps to your life.<br>&nbsp;</p>', '2023-01-28 06:33:48', 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 'how to improve your health,how to improve your health and wellness,health,fitness,how to improve your overall health,how to improve your health and fitness,improve your health and fitness,improve your health and fitness routine,how to improve your overall health and wellness,how to improve your health and wellbeing,health and wellness,how to improve your heart health,how to improve your fitness,where to begin your health and fitness journey', 'how to improve your health,how to improve your health and wellness,health,fitness,how to improve your overall health,how to improve your health and fitness,improve your health and fitness,improve your health and fitness routine,how to improve your overall health and wellness,how to improve your health and wellbeing,health and wellness,how to improve your heart health,how to improve your fitness,where to begin your health and fitness journey', 1),

Cavities and tooth rot are among the world\'s normal dental issues. They\'re particularly normal in kids, teenagers and old people. But this doesn&rsquo;t mean those in their twenties, thirties or forties cannot get cavities. If you have teeth you have a risk of getting tooth cavities.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Moreover, if you got a cavity and you are not treating it, you are making things even more worst. They can prompt serious toothache, tooth contamination and tooth loss.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">What are the symptoms that show you are dealing with tooth cavities?</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Depending upon the extent and location of your tooth symptoms of the cavity can vary. At the beginning of the occurrence of cavity, there might be no symptoms at all but as the decay gets longer and worsen it starts showing symptoms like:</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\">&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sudden pain without any cause, and toothache<br>&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sensitivity in the tooth<br>&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mild sharp pain while eating or drinking hot and cold food items<br>&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;Holes in tooth<br>&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;Tooth decay<br>&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;Pain on biting anything<br>&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;Black stains on the tooth surface<br>&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;Bad breathe<br>&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;Tenderness on eating sweet dishes<br>&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;Unpleasant taste in the mouth</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Sometimes you don&rsquo;t even come to know that your tooth has a cavity until it get worst. So it is very important to visit your dentist on regular intervals and get your dental checkup done. Your mouth also feels healthy and fresh if you get your cleaning done from time to time.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">What are the causes behind tooth cavities?</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Tooth decay is the main reason of tooth cavities. Tooth decay is a process that occurs over time. There are the following reasons for tooth decay:-</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">1.&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Plaque forms</strong> - It is a kind of clear sticky layer that covers your teeth. This happens because of eating too much of sugary items and starchy food and not cleaning the teeth well. If you don&rsquo;t clean your teeth well after eating sweet and sugary items, bacteria quickly start feeding on it and forms plaque.<br>Plaque on staying for long on your teeth starts to form tartar which makes it more difficult to clean the plaque off your teeth.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">2.&nbsp; <strong>Swollen gums and roots</strong> - As tooth rot creates bacteria and acid continues to destroy your teeth moving close to the internal tooth material (pulp). The pulp contains nerves and blood vessels. This leads to swollen pulp and gums.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">3.&nbsp;<strong> Holes in the enamel </strong>- When the plaque accumulates on your teeth, its acid removes minerals from the enamel. This leads to erosion and holes in enamels. These enamel holes are also known to be the initial stage of the cavity.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If left untreated bacteria through these holes can reach the next layer of your tooth called dentin. Dentin is less resistant to acid and rots very fast. Dentin being in direct contact to nerve starts causing sensitivity.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">How to avoid Tooth cavity?</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There are the following ways you can opt for to avoid tooth cavities:</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">1. &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Brush with toothpaste containing fluoride</strong>: &nbsp;make a habit of brushing twice a day, especially after your last meal. Use fluoride-enriched toothpaste for cleaning the residue of your food from your teeth.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">2. &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Regular visits to dentist</strong>: Visit to your dentist at regular intervals helps in keeping teeth healthy. It also helps in early spotting of the problem in your teeth.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">3. &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Sealants</strong>: A sealant is a defensive plastic covering applied to the biting surface of back teeth. It helps in protecting enamel from plaque attack.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">4. &nbsp; <strong>&nbsp;Avoid sugary items</strong>: &nbsp;Too much consumption of sweet and sugary foods leads to the creation of plaque. It accelerates the bacteria attack and acid creation that destroys enamel.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">5. &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Flossing</strong>: &nbsp;using floss to clean your teeth can help you get rid of that stuck food particles between your teeth and prevent bacteria formation.<br><br></p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;A few changes you can make in your eating habits are:</h3>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\">1. &nbsp; &nbsp;Limit fruit juice consumption<br>2. &nbsp; &nbsp;Limit your cookies, chocolates and candies consumption<br>3. &nbsp; &nbsp;Limit sweet beverages<br>4. &nbsp; &nbsp;Limit your snacking over junk food<br>5. &nbsp; &nbsp;Avoid substances that dry your mouth.<br>6. &nbsp; &nbsp;Avoid sticky food<br>7. &nbsp; &nbsp;Avoid hard to crack food<br>8. &nbsp; &nbsp;Stop consuming extremely hot or extremely cold food.<br>9. &nbsp; &nbsp;Limit your wine consumption<br>10. &nbsp; &nbsp;Limit coffee and tea consumption</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Summary</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;Tooth cavities are a common dental issue that can occur due to erosion of the enamel of the teeth. Cavities can cause pain, infection, and tooth loss if left untreated. Good oral hygiene, includes brushing and flossing regularly, can help prevent cavities. It is also important to visit a dentist regularly for cleanings and checkup. If you do have a cavity, your dentist can recommend treatment options such as fillings, crowns, or root canals. By taking care of your teeth, you can maintain healthy teeth and a beautiful smile.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Note : The information provided here is for general informational purposes only and is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

(38, 10, 20, 'Alternative Therapies - An Insight', 'Proceed.Fit', 'uploads/Alternative_Therapies1.png', '', '<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Medical treatments that are not included in traditional medicine techniques are referred to as \"<strong>alternative therapies</strong>.\" Alternative therapies could be used in addition to conventional medicine. The terms \"complementary medicine\" and \"alternative medicine\" are synonymous. In the medical field, the practice is known as complementary and alternative medicine (CAM).&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Alternative techniques are used in place of conventional medicine by most people. People use these therapies in addition to traditional medicine.<br>Alternative therapies come in a variety of forms. Many of these therapies have made their way into mainstream medicine over the years. There are numerous types of alternative therapies. The National Institute for Complementary and Integrative Health divided alternative therapies into the following categories:</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; padding-left: 40px;\">&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;Acupuncture<br>&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;Homeopathy<br>&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;Naturopathy<br>&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;Chiropractic<br>&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;Meditation/Reiki<br>&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;Massage therapy<br>&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;Reflexology<br>&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hypnosis</p>\r\n<h2>Acupuncture:</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Acupuncture is a technique that involves inserting very thin needles through your skin at strategic points on your body. Acupuncture is commonly used to treat pain ranging from nominal to severe. It is increasingly being used for overall wellness and to treat stress. To treat various health issues, acupuncture specialists insert needles at various parts of the body at certain depths. Acupuncturists insert very thin steel needles into the patient&rsquo;s skin at various \"acupoints.\" The needles rebalance the body&rsquo;s energy, known as qi, and cause the body to release natural chemicals to combat the illness or symptom. Acupuncture can treat many types of health problems. It is generally used to relieve chronic pain, such as arthritis, back pain, muscle pain, headaches and migraines, knee pain, menstrual cramps, and sports injuries.</p>\r\n<h2>Homeopathy:</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Homeopathy is an alternative medicine that believes the body can heal itself. It is a practice in which trace amounts of natural substances, such as plants and minerals, are used to provide treatments. Homeopathic doctors believe that the body itself aids in the healing process. It was invented in Germany in the late 1700s. Homeopaths believe that the more medicine is diluted, the more effective it is at treating symptoms. Many homeopathic remedies are made up of substances that have been diluted many times in water until almost none of the original substance remains. The most common conditions for which people choose homeopathic treatment are asthma, ear infections, hay fever, mental illness, allergies, dermatitis (an allergic skin condition), arthritis, and hypertension.</p>\r\n<h2>Naturopathy:</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Naturopathy is also known as \"naturopathic medicine.\" It uses a wide array of pseudoscientific practices branded as \"natural\" or \"self-healing\" and employed by its practitioners, who are known as naturopaths. These treatments range from outright dietary and lifestyle changes to manipulative therapies, such as certain forms of psychotherapy. Naturopaths advise you regarding dietary and lifestyle changes, stress reduction, manipulative therapies, exercise therapy, guided detoxification, and counseling. Naturopathy is the most ancient form of health care, combining modern scientific knowledge with traditional and natural forms of medicine. Naturopathy stimulates the human body&rsquo;s ability to heal itself by relying on nature&rsquo;s healing power. It stimulates spiritual healing, health strengthening, and disease prevention to treat the patient.</p>\r\n<h2>Chiropractic:</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Chiropractic is a form of alternative medicine that assists in the diagnosis, cure, and prevention of neuro-musculoskeletal conditions or medical problems. Chiropractic doctors are known as chiropractors or chiropractic physicians. Chiropractors use their hands to diagnose and prefer a drug-free method known as spinal manipulation or adjustment to treat patients. Chiropractors have a wide range of diagnostic skills and are also trained to recommend rehabilitative and therapeutic exercises as well as nutrition and lifestyle counseling.</p>\r\n<h2>Meditation and Reiki:</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Meditation is a practice in which a person trains their mind to be attentive and aware. In this practice, a person focuses their mind on a specific object, thought, or activity. It is a therapy performed since ancient times and practiced by several cultures. Meditation has proven difficult to define because it encompasses a diverse range of practices in various traditions. The term \"meditation\" is frequently used imprecisely in popular usage to designate practices found in many cultures. The meditators believe all the problems can be healed by using mind power. For them, mind power is supreme of all and cures every disease.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Reiki refers to the universal energy that is received by everyone all the time. Believers say that universal energy flows through one&rsquo;s body in the same way that water flows through a river: continuously and joyfully. Reiki makes a person sensitive enough to recognize the energy within and sensible enough to use the energy for strengthening, healing, relaxing, and rejuvenating oneself.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>Massage:</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Massage therapy is also known as myotherapy. It is the practice of manipulating a person&rsquo;s muscles and other soft tissues to improve their health and relieve their pain. Myotherapy is a manual therapy in which the muscles, tendons, ligaments, and fascia are pressured. One of the most immediate advantages of massage is a sense of deep relaxation and calm. Massage causes the release of endorphins, which are brain neurotransmitters that produce feelings of happiness. Hormones like adrenalin, cortisol, and noradrenaline &nbsp;are also reduced.</p>\r\n<h2>Reflexology:</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Reflexology is also known as zone therapy in many cultures. It is a complementary medicine practise that involves applying pressure to specific points on the feet, ears, and hands. This is accomplished without the use of oil or lotion and by using thumb, finger, and hand massage techniques. According to reflexology practitioners, areas of these zones in the feet, hands, and ears correspond to organs and systems of the body.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Hypnosis:</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Hypnotherapy practitioners use hypnosis to treat specific mental conditions. The hypnosis procedure entails being guided into a deep subconscious state in which a hypnotherapist can access your thoughts and beliefs. When you are in a hypnotic state, a hypnotherapist will give you suggestions to help encourage behavioural change or relieve your symptoms. Hypnotherapy can be used to treat addiction, anxiety, or depression.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Conclusion:</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There is evidence to suggest that certain alternative therapies may be effective for certain conditions, although the quality and strength of this evidence varies. In some cases, alternative therapies may be used in conjunction with conventional medical treatments to provide additional benefits. However, it is important to note that alternative therapies are not always safe and may not be suitable for everyone. It is always advisable to speak with a healthcare professional before starting any new treatment, including alternative therapies.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In conclusion, alternative therapies are a diverse group of healthcare practices and approaches that may be used to complement or supplement conventional medical treatments. While some may be effective for certain conditions, it is important to carefully consider the safety and effectiveness of these therapies before starting any new treatment.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt;\">Note : The information provided here is for general informational purposes only and is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

(39, 10, 21, 'Chronic disease management | Diabetes, Heart Disease, Cancer', 'Proceed.Fit', 'uploads/DISEASES.png', '', '<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Chronic diseases are the most severe diseases that affect more than one organ. Such diseases lasts longer than one month. Chronic diseases place a heavy strain on society, and conventional healthcare delivery models cannot meet these needs. A novel approach to treating chronic diseases called \"chronic disease administration\" has arisen, but no standard measure has been provided.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Chronic diseases are common in older people as they lack strong immunity. Hypertension, and arthritis are the most common types of chronic diseases. The cause of many chronic diseases is linked to unhealthy lifestyle choices. Many of these diseases and conditions can be avoided by eating nutritious foods, becoming more physically active, and avoiding tobacco use.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Diabetes: a major concern</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Diabetes is a disease generally present in adults over the age of 30. Diabetes is among the major chronic diseases. It is caused by low insulin levels in our body. Insulin is a hormone that is produced by beta cells in the pancreas. It is the hormone that regulates blood sugar levels in the body. Dysfunction of pancreas or inability of beta cells decreases efficiency of producing insulin.&nbsp;<br>Diabetes is of two types: insulin-dependent diabetes and non-insulin-dependent diabetes. Insulin-dependent diabetes, also known as type 1 diabetes, is caused by a deficiency of insulin due to decreased production. It requires the daily administration of insulin. Type 1 diabetes is passed on genetically. Non-insulin-dependent diabetes is commonly known as type 2 diabetes. It is caused by the body&rsquo;s inability to use insulin. In simple words, type 1 diabetes is caused by the dysfunction of beta cells in the pancreas, while type 2 diabetes is caused by the dysfunction of the body&rsquo;s cells to use insulin.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Diabetes has been found to offer a useful example of managing a chronic condition. The crucial role that patient self-management plays in many chronic illnesses, including cardiovascular disease, asthma, and COPD, is particularly intriguing.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Heart disease: a fatal disease.</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality around the world. One should not delay if signs show up. The heart is the most important organ of the body, as it pumps the blood. The blood delivers nutrition and oxygen to all the cells in the body. The heart and blood make up the cardiovascular system. Therefore, damage to the heart means damage to the whole body. Heart diseases like heart attack, stroke, arrhythmia, heart valve disease, cardiomyopathy, etc. are chronic diseases that last for more than a year and affect more than the cardiovascular system.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The first symptoms of cardiovascular disease include chest pain, breathlessness, or palpitations; high blood pressure; fatigue; and dizziness. Patients should take action as soon as they notice any risk factors. Other risk factors of heart disease are a history of the disease in the family, stress, and high cholesterol. Other significant heart disease risk factors include:</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; padding-left: 40px;\">1) Smoking<br>2) High cholesterol and blood pressure<br>3) Diabetes<br>4) Sedentary lifestyle</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">One should immediately consult a cardiologist. Treating heart disease is really crucial, and the patient should take seriously all the advice and medications provided by the doctor. Personal care and a healthy lifestyle can prevent chronic diseases like heart problems and add years to your life.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Cancer: a slow killer</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Cancer is the collective term used to characterize uncontrolled cell growth in the body. In medical terms, it is known as neoplasia. In normal cells of our bodies, there is a predetermined life cycle to follow. In a cancer patient, however, this cycle is unchecked. The cell cycle passes through the checkpoints, and the cells continue to grow in quantity. It keeps on dividing and growing.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There are several types of cancer, which are typically named after the organs they affect, such as the skin, lung, pancreas, blood, and stomach, among others. Cancer is classified based on its severity. They&rsquo;re either benign or malignant. Benign tumours are stationary tumours that affect only an organ. Benign tumours are named with the suffix \"oma.\" Malignant cancers are fatal and can spread to other parts of the body. They are named with the suffix \"sarcoma\" for connective tissue and \"carcinoma\" for epithelial tissues.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">However, there are primarily five types of cancer when classified biologically. Leukemia, melanoma, carcinoma, sarcoma, and lymphoma are among them. Leukemia is a cancer that begins in the bone marrow and is a blood cancer. Tumors do not form in this type of cancer. Melanoma is considered one of the most dangerous types of cancer because the skin\'s melanin becomes cancerous. Carcinomas are cancers of various glands or organs, including the breasts, stomach, lungs, and pancreas. Sarcomas are cancers of the connective tissues, such as the bones and muscles.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Common symptoms, regardless of the site of affection, of cancer are abnormal bumps, bloody sputum, fevers, night sweats, or unintentional weight loss. A variety of factors in today&rsquo;s living environment are capable of causing cancer. Carcinogens are substances that are known to cause cancer or increase the risk of cancer. Carcinogens can be found in everything from pollutants to tobacco to processed meats. Carcinogens can be present genetically.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Cancer is a chronic disease that requires an instant doctor&rsquo;s attention and treatment. Surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy are the most commonly used cancer treatments. Chemotherapy treatment consists of a cocktail of drugs designed to kill cancer cells. These treatments are frequently administered together. In the case of benign tumors, surgery is usually performed, followed by a short cycle of preventive chemotherapy. Radiation therapy, on the other hand, employs electromagnetic rays to destroy cancerous cells.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Conclusion</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Managing chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and cancer, require a multifaceted approach that includes both medical treatment and lifestyle changes. Effective management of chronic diseases can improve the quality of life for patients, reduce healthcare costs and mitigate the burden on the healthcare system. The importance of identifying and managing risk factors, implementing regular screenings and developing individualized treatment plans cannot be overstated. Additionally, early detection and intervention can prevent chronic disease from progressing and becoming more severe, ultimately resulting in better outcomes for patients. However, there is still a need for more research to improve understanding of these diseases and identify new treatment options. Furthermore, addressing social determinants of health, such as access to nutritious food and safe environments, is crucial in the prevention and management of chronic diseases. Chronic disease management requires continued collaboration between patients, healthcare providers and policymakers to improve outcomes and the lives of those affected by these conditions.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt;\">Disclaimer: The information provided here is for general informational purposes only and is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

Living a healthy lifestyle is essential if you want to lead a life filled with happiness and feel good in the present and in the future. When you choose to live a healthy lifestyle, it will last the rest of your life. It not only makes you live longer but also healthier and less susceptible to illness and disease. A healthy lifestyle is something that we should all strive for.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">People tend to follow the wrong tips given by the internet in order to achieve goals like slimming themselves, increasing their height, and attaining a long life. Some people develop wrong beliefs and practice things that are hazardous to their health. Here, the most important thing is to get the correct guidance and differentiate between myths and facts.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Here are five popular myths busted&nbsp;</h2>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Myth 1: Carbs are bad for weight loss</strong></h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">After hearing and reading interviews with fitness-freak celebrities, people often give up on carbs and live on protein-rich foods and salads. It is not advisable and can cause problems like gout and kidney problems since there is an excess amount of protein in the body. Carbs are a good source of instant energy, and energy is required to digest proteins and other nutrients. It is a balanced diet that provides nutrients to help your body function properly and become healthy. The importance of diet lies in consuming the proper amount of fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and proteins. Neglecting one of them can cause an imbalance in your diet and problems in the future.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br><strong>Myth 2: Skipping meals can help you lose weight</strong></h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Fasting or starving is a very short-term ailment to lose weight. It has more side effects than benefits. Skipping meals can slow down the body&rsquo;s metabolism and lead to fatigue. It then results in overeating, which is also harmful for our health. A person should have three meals per day at regular intervals. It is important to have a regular and balanced diet.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br><strong>Myth 3: You can&rsquo;t prevent a heart attack</strong></h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A heart attack is a condition in which, for a period of time, the heart doesn&rsquo;t get a proper amount of blood supply. Some people are susceptible to heart attacks due to genetic factors. A heart attack can be prevented by adopting a healthy lifestyle. There are certain things to keep in mind in order to prevent a heart attack. These include a proper diet with less cholesterol, a cardio workout to increase the efficiency of the heart, and regular body checks to keep track of your heart conditions. A person with high blood pressure or high cholesterol is susceptible to a heart attack and should treat the disease as soon as possible.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Myth 4: Antibiotics can cure all diseases</strong></h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Antibiotics are medicines used to treat bacterial diseases. Antibiotics must be prescribed by doctors. People generally consume antibiotics without a doctor&rsquo;s prescription, as overconsumption of antibiotics can develop an antibiotic-resistant strain of bacteria. Drugs like antibiotics have several side effects, including fatigue, headaches, and fever. Antibiotics are not useful in cases of viral disease or a disease developed due to poor immunity or dysfunction of any body part. It is only useful in cases of bacterial diseases and must be used under specific prescription by the doctor.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Myth 5: Spicy and fatty foods are the only causes of acidity</strong></h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Acidity is actually an over secretion of acid present in the stomach. Its causes may include spicy and fatty foods, but that is not the sole cause. Unhealthy practises like smoking, drinking, and the side effects of medication can also lead to acidity. Also, stress and anxiety can cause acidity.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A person must dust away all the myths by researching and consulting a doctor. It is important to realise that wrong practises can further harm your health rather than benefit it.<br>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt;\">Disclaimer: The information provided here is for general informational purposes only and is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

This is because of the lazy lifestyle and improper eating habits we have developed. The lifestyle choices you make decide how healthy your body will be. It has a direct impact on the cholesterol level in the body too.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Your body already produces the cholesterol it requires for functioning, but an unhealthy lifestyle gives an invitation to a high level of LDL (also known as bad cholesterol) in the body.</p>\r\n<h3>What kind of lifestyle impacts high cholesterol levels in the body?</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As already mentioned the lifestyle you choose has a direct impact on the cholesterol levels in the body.

By blocking this protein, REPATHA helps to lower LDL cholesterol levels and reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke. It is usually prescribed to people who have high cholesterol levels despite taking statin therapy and is given as a subcutaneous injection. It\'s a new alternative for those who are struggling to control their cholesterol levels. It\'s important to note that REPATHA should be used under the guidance of a healthcare professional and it may not be suitable for everyone.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 8pt;\">Disclaimer: The information provided here is for general informational purposes only and is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

Weight loss has been a hot topic for uncountable years now and people are experimenting with different methods to achieve it..</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Individuals are making a significant effort to lose excess weight, whether it be by reducing calorie intake, creating a workout plan, incorporating weight loss-promoting diets into their eating habits, or making lifestyle changes. All these methods have been tried by people to reach their desired weight.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">There are several diets and routines that have recently gained popularity for weight loss. Some examples include:</h3>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\">&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) workout :&nbsp;</strong>which involves short bursts of intense exercise followed by periods of rest.<br>&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Yoga and Pilates :</strong>&nbsp;which focus on building strength and flexibility while promoting weight loss.<br>&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Keto diet :</strong> This diet primarily aims at cutting down the carbohydrates from the food you eat. This promotes the loss of water weight from the body which ultimately helps in lowering the overall weight of the body.<br>&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Plant-based diet :</strong> More of a decline towards the vegan pattern this diet focuses on only consuming a plant-based diet. More fibrous food and fewer calories consumed are the mottoes behind this plant-based diet.<br>&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Home workouts :</strong> working out at home have always been a good option for losing weight. Working out not only helps in losing weight but also strengthens the muscles. It helps us in staying fit and energetic.<br>&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Intermittent fasting :</strong> This routine has gained a lot of popularity and has been practiced by a huge number of people for weight loss. It is a disciplined way of eating which distributes your day into 2 windows, namely- the eating window and the fasting window.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">How intermittent fasting works?</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lets us understand intermittent fasting in detail</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Intermittent fasting has been proven really helpful when it comes to weight loss programs. When your day is divided into eating and fasting windows you make a discipline for yourself. You can only eat in the eating window which is generally 8 hours according to the most famous pattern of 16:8.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In the 16:8 type of pattern, you have to fast for 16 hours and you can only eat for 8 hours. You have to decide your meals accordingly so as to make it fit in the pattern.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Intermittent fasting has been found to have many health benefits:</h3>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\">&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;Weight loss<br>&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;Disciplined eating structure<br>&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;Reduces inflammation<br>&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;Keeps heart problems away<br>&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;Reducing the risk of diabetes<br>&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;Reduces oxidative stress<br>&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;Managing blood pressure<br>&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lowering cholesterol levels</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Is it a miracle?</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Despite so many advantages and health benefits intermittent fasting is providing do remember it is not a magical tool for weight loss. Merely deciding to go for intermittent fasting and not following it with discipline will not take you anywhere.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It requires a lot of commitment and discipline to follow this diet. There has been much research conducted which proves that many people who followed intermittent fasting for their weight loss ended up dropping it. It is tough to follow intermittent fasting because of its strict time patterns.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It is found to be less sustainable in the future as people find it difficult to tolerate hunger for longer hours. It is not easy to starve yourself especially when you are a working person and spend hours and hours doing physical work.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Starving for long hours can give you irritation and mood swings. Also, it can make your body weak.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Intermittent fasting can result in following problems if you don&rsquo;t follow it with discipline:</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Over-eating</strong>- Because of being strict in nature not everyone follows it with honesty and the urge to eat increases. This can lead you to overeat. Feasting days are the worst in that scenario. On feasting days when you are free to eat you tend to compensate for the previous fasting days. As a result, you overeat.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Because of being deprived of food for longer hours, the urge to eat more is very natural, and if you don&rsquo;t have good controlling power you will eat even more. How strong your willpower is and how strong you can control yourself plays a major role in following this fasting method.<br>Sometimes due to intense fasting hunger becomes extreme which also ends up in over-eating and making unhealthy food choices.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Reduced physical activities</strong>- Fasting for longer hours can lead to fewer or reduced physical activities. The reason behind this can be hunger which makes you weak. You can feel lethargic because of being food deprived for longer hours.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In order to keep your body active, make it a habit to exercise daily. Force yourself to do some physical activities. If you are a sports person or an athlete try some other options than intermittent fasting.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Tired and moody</strong>- long hours of fasting can keep you in stress and can make you moody. Stress can lead to feeling low on energy, fatigue, and extremely moody. When you are tired you don&rsquo;t perform to the best of your potential.<br>Mood swings are also very common when you are fasting for long hours. You can become impatient and irritated when being hungry for longer hours.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Intermittent fasting becomes tough when you are already dealing with mood swings. This can also lead you to quit intermittent fasting.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&bull; &nbsp; <strong>&nbsp;Eating disorder</strong>- Restrictive eating can result in eating disorders. The more you starve the more you end up having a negative relationship with food. If you had any previous eating disorder try before you go for intermittent fasting.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Maintaining a clear and focused mindset on your weight loss goals is essential for the success of any diet or workout routine. Discipline and commitment are key to sticking to intermittent fasting or any other weight loss method. Without 100% dedication, no method will yield the desired results.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To achieve the physique you desire, it is important to make a genuine effort towards your goal. Losing weight can be challenging and following intermittent fasting or other methods can be even more difficult. However, without determination and commitment, it will not lead to successful weight loss.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt;\">Disclaimer: The information provided here is for general informational purposes only and is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

Virtual consultations have become a mega trend and is expected to continue to grow even after the pandemic has subsided. As healthcare providers increasingly offer telemedicine services, patients can now receive quality medical care from the comfort and safety of their own homes. The pandemic has emphasized the need for contactless healthcare solutions, and telemedicine has emerged as a game-changer in the medical industry.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Let&rsquo;s understand what Telemedicine is first,</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The use of telecommunication technology for remote diagnosis and treatment of patients is called Telemedicine. It does not require direct contact between the healthcare provider and the patient. All you need a telecommunication media and good internet.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">What enables the proper functioning of Telemedicine?</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There are various components and channels that ensure a seamless telemedicine experience. Some of the components are:</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\">&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;Computer or mobile phone<br>&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;Cameras<br>&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;Audio and / or Video conferencing<br>&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;Internet</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Telemedicine has eliminated the barrier of distance in healthcare. With virtual consultations, healthcare providers can treat patients in remote or distant locations without the need for in-person visits or face-to-face interactions.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Types of Telemedicine</h2>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Telemedicine is of various types. Some of them are:</h3>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;Real-time medicine </strong></h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Also known as &ldquo;live medicine&rdquo; which makes the treatment real-time basis. It enables easy interaction between the doctor and patient anytime and anywhere. It is a type of two-way communication process possible through video-conferencing or phone consultations.<br>This makes the consultation and treatment real-time. Various medical practices that are possible with the help of telemedicine are:<br>o &nbsp; &nbsp;psychiatric evaluations<br>o &nbsp; &nbsp;Assessments of medical history<br>o &nbsp; &nbsp;Basic visual examinations<br>o &nbsp; &nbsp;Ophthalmic tests<br>It uses real-time data to make evaluations of patient health. Data can be sent via telecommunication media.

Technology is playing a major role in the transfer and distribution of various medical images, x-rays and CT scans from one expert to another. It enables instant transmission of such data from point of capture to the medical service provider.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It has been of great help when an expert&rsquo;s opinion is needed. You can get an opinion even when the expert is miles away from you.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">How telemedicine helps in reaching patients?</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Telemedicine is the new face of healthcare services. On account of telemedicine, medical services experts have different ways of associating with patients in their own homes. Various web-based features like patient portals permit suppliers to share essential data and answer basic inquiries.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Patient portals can be utilized to suggest health-centered mobile apps or instructive materials, like articles and recordings related to health conditions and possible treatments.

With telemedicine, patients no longer have to travel long distances to receive medical treatment and can easily connect with their healthcare provider from the comfort of their own homes. Additionally, telemedicine has proven to be a cost-effective solution and has greatly reduced the burden on traditional healthcare systems. Furthermore, the private sector has also seen the potential in telemedicine and has invested in the field, leading to increased growth and development. Overall, telemedicine has brought about a new era in the healthcare industry and is set to continue growing in the future.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt;\">Note : The information provided here is for general informational purposes only and is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

style=\"text-align: justify;\">Certain characteristics, such as more sensitive and less oily skin, and multiple etiopathogenic factors, such as the modern woman\'s increased work and household activities, stress, sleep disturbances, dietary supplements, and certain types of contraceptive methods, make treatment more difficult.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Recent data on its

treatment.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The literature shows that the impact on quality of life does not always correlate with acne severity.&nbsp;In some cases, women with mild clinical conditions show a lower quality of life.&nbsp;Research has also shown that the psychological impact of acne appears to affect more women than men.&nbsp;In any case, the attention of the

Acalculous cholecystitis is frequently linked to issues like the gallbladder being accidentally damaged during major surgery, severe wounds or burns, blood poisoning (sepsis), extreme starvation, or AIDS. When a gallstone or biliary sludge obstructs the cystic duct, the major access point to the gallbladder, calculous cholecystitis results.

Sore throat is rather seen as a symptom of respiratory tract disease more than an actual disease. Usually, a sore throat heals on its own. Yet, one might use over-the-counter medications or throat lozenges to treat a sore throat. Try a cough syrup based on the type of cough.

This is due to the fact that having a tight waist belt can alter anterior pelvic tilt. (where your pelvis is rotated forward and the spine is curved). This usually happens while seated or standing, and it causes increased abdominal pressure by narrowing the waist circumference and decreasing the space within the abdominal cavity. Learn about other lifestyle variables that can increase your acidity risk.</span></p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-12 marginTop-16\">\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>', '<h2>Diagnosis Of Acidity</h2>\r\n<p>It is advisable to see a doctor if you experience any acidity signs, such as burping (leaving a sour flavour in your mouth), regurgitation, bloating, or burning pain or discomfort (also known as heartburn). To determine the cause, your doctor may perform a physical check and ask you a few questions about your daily activities.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Your doctor might decide against recommending any procedures if your symptoms are minor. However, your doctor might advise further testing if your symptoms don\'t go away after therapy or if you experience symptoms like internal bleeding or trouble swallowing.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><br><strong>The tests include:</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Upper GI endoscopy:</strong> The lining of the esophagus, stomach, and small intestine are examined using an endoscope, which is a tiny flexible tube inserted in the throat.</p>\r\n<p><strong>2.</strong> <strong>pH monitoring:</strong> By measuring the amount of stomach acid that enters through the food pipe and how long it remains in the stomach, this test best aids in measuring stomach acid production.</p>\r\n<p><strong>3. Barium swallow test (esophagram):</strong>&nbsp;In this, you need to drink a liquid barium mixture and get an X-ray of the chest and upper abdomen done to help identify any physical abnormalities in the stomach or esophagus.</p>\r\n<p><strong>4. Esophageal manometry:</strong> It is a procedure that assists in determining how well the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) and esophageal muscles are working. If the food you consume can pass through your oesophagus normally or not, it will let your doctor know.</p>\r\n<p><strong>5. Electrocardiogram (ECG):</strong> If you experience severe chest pain or discomfort, an ECG may occasionally be advised to examine your heart health. Additionally, depending on your condition and the symptoms, other tests, like a biopsy, may be suggested.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em><strong>&nbsp;</strong></em></p>', '<h2>Prevention Of Acidity<br><br></h2>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A few easy tips and tricks can assist you in preventing and managing acidity.

According to studies, sleeping on the right side can exacerbate the symptoms of acid reflux. This is because lying on your right side increases the likelihood of acid leaking through the LES, raising the risk of heartburn.

However, if you have severe chest pain, discomfort, or heartburn that is different or worse than normal, see a doctor.

In simple terms, it is a condition that causes excess acid production in the stomach. This not only causes discomfort in the stomach but also leads to other symptoms, such as a sour taste in the mouth, difficulty swallowing, and&nbsp;<a href=\"../frontend/diseases\">indigestion</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There are numerous causes of acidity, right from poor eating habits and excessive stress to the use of certain medications. Moreover, lifestyle factors, such as smoking and consuming foods loaded with oil, fats, and spices, can also up your risk of acidity.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you experience acidity once in a while, it may not indicate any health issues. However, if you suffer from frequent bouts of acidity, where the symptoms occur at least two or more days per week, there might be some underlying disorder associated with it. It is advised to consult your doctor in such cases.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You can fight acidity with simple lifestyle changes and effective home remedies, such as&nbsp;<a href=\"../frontend/diseases\">tulsi</a>, mint,&nbsp;<a href=\"../frontend/diseases\">fennel seeds</a>, and cold milk. In most cases, over-the-counter medications to reduce/neutralize the acid are known to be of great help.</p>\r\n</div>', '<h2>Symptoms Of Acidity<br><br></h2>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The symptoms of acidity occur when some of the acid content of the stomach flows back up into the esophagus or the food pipe, which connects the mouth to the stomach. Normally, a ring of muscle called the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) acts as a valve that lets food enter the stomach but does not allow it back up into the esophagus. When this valve fails to function properly, stomach contents are regurgitated into the esophagus and the following symptoms of acidity can be experienced:</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">1. Heartburn</h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Despite the name, heartburn has nothing to do with the heart. It is a common symptom of acidity that is caused when the excess stomach acid leaks out into the esophagus, leading to a burning sensation in the chest. This feeling can last for a few minutes to several hours.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">2. Regurgitation</h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Some people with acidity may experience regurgitation. It is a feeling in which the person may feel liquid undigested food, bile, or stomach acid moving up and down in the throat. This sensation is somewhat similar to the feeling of being pukish and usually occurs post meals, exercising, or bending right after eating.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">3. Sour taste in the mouth</h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Another common symptom of stomach ailments, a sour taste in the mouth, is also a symptom of acidity. It happens when food, along with stomach acid and bile, rises up to the back of your throat, causing a bitter taste. This usually happens along with regurgitation.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">4. Difficulty in swallowing</h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Difficulty in swallowing, also known as dysphagia, happens when excess acid in the stomach causes a feeling of fullness. It also causes a delay in the movement of food through the food pipe and impedes digestion.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">5. Sore throat</h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When the stomach acid moves up to the mouth it can irritate the vocal cords or the voice box, leading to sore throat or hoarseness.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">6. Indigestion</h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Indigestion, also known as dyspepsia, can also be a key sign of acidity and other digestive problems. It can lead to a feeling of discomfort and a burning sensation in the upper middle part of the stomach.&nbsp;</p>', '<div id=\"Symptoms\" class=\"style__dynamic-widget___39jlH\">\r\n<div class=\"container-fluid widget-container\">\r\n<div class=\"col-12 marginTop-8\">\r\n<h2>Causes Of Acidity<br><br></h2>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The stomach produces gastric acids that help in digesting food.

This is because wearing a tight waist belt can cause a change in anterior pelvic tilt (where your pelvis is rotated forward and the spine is curved). This mostly occurs when sitting or standing and causes an increased abdominal pressure by narrowing the waist circumference and a decreased space within the abdominal cavity.

Your doctor might do some physical examination followed by a few questions related to your daily routine to know the cause of it.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If your symptoms are mild, your doctor might not recommend any tests. However, if your symptoms fail to show any improvement post-treatment or if you experience symptoms such as internal bleeding or difficulty in swallowing, then your doctor might recommend further investigation.<br><strong><br>The tests include:</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>1. Upper GI endoscopy:</strong>&nbsp;In this, a small flexible tube (known as endoscope) is inserted down the throat to examine the lining of the esophagus, stomach, and small intestine.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>2. pH monitoring:</strong>&nbsp;This test helps measure stomach acid by checking how much stomach acid enters through the food pipe and how long it stays in the stomach.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>3. Barium swallow test (esophagram):</strong>&nbsp;In this, you need to drink a liquid barium mixture and get an X-ray of the chest and upper abdomen done to help identify any physical abnormalities in the stomach or esophagus.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>4. Esophageal manometry:</strong>&nbsp;It is a test that helps check the function of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) and the muscles of the esophagus. It will tell your doctor if the food you eat can move through the esophagus normally or not.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>5. Electrocardiogram (ECG):&nbsp;</strong>In some cases ECG is also recommended if you report severe chest pain or discomfort to check your heart condition. Additionally, other tests, such as biopsy, can also be recommended based on your condition and the symptoms.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><br><em><strong>To get the right diagnosis, it is important to consult the right doctor.

These include:&nbsp;<br><br></p>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>1. Eat small, frequent meals</strong></h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">One of the simple tips to lower your risk of acid reflux is to eat small yet frequent meals. This is because overeating puts extra pressure on the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), a valve-like muscle which prevents the acid content in the stomach from entering the esophagus.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>2. Eat a low-carb diet</strong></h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A&nbsp;<a href=\"../frontend/diseases\">study</a>&nbsp;has reported that a low-carb diet can improve heartburn symptoms, especially in obese individuals. It may be because excess carbohydrates can make you gassy and bloated, which in turn can lead to heartburn.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>3. Chew your food properly</strong></h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When you eat slowly and chew your food properly, it provides sufficient time for the digestive juices to break down the food and digest it. This, in turn, can help you beat indigestion, acidity, and heartburn.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>4. Avoid eating late at night</strong></h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Unhealthy eating habits are one of the leading causes of digestion-related problems. Eating late at night because of work pressure or snacking heavily in the evening can, in turn, make you more prone to heartburn. Therefore, avoid this habit of late-night snacking or eating close to bedtime.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>5. Limit consumption of spicy and deep-fried foods</strong></h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Regular intake of highly spicy food can stimulate excessive gastric acid production. Similarly, deep-fried foods are slow to digest and trigger more acid production. Hence, these kinds of food should always be consumed in moderation.<br><br></p>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><em><strong>Do you know what foods to eat and what to avoid in acidity?

Limit caffeine and carbonated beverages intake</strong></h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">One of the key ways to prevent heartburn is to avoid foods that trigger acid reflux. Caffeine-containing food and drinks, like tea or coffee, are highly acidic in nature and stimulate excessive gastric acid production. Likewise, carbonated beverages increase acidity because carbonation bubbles expand in the stomach and put pressure on the LES to open in the wrong direction and cause regurgitation of gastric acid.</p>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</h3>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>7. Limit your alcohol intake</strong></h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It goes without saying that drinking alcohol is bad for your health, especially, if you suffer from heartburn. Alcohol increases your risk of acid reflux and also worsens the condition. It irritates the lining of the stomach and impairs the ability of the LES to clear up acid. Hence, avoid alcohol to ease the symptoms of heartburn.</p>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</h3>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>8. Quit smoking</strong></h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Nicotine in cigarettes can relax the LES and trigger acidity. Hence, for the prevention of acidity and many other health benefits, it is always advisable to quit smoking.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em><strong><br>Tobacco is injurious to the health.

(1, 'Asthma', 'Asthma is basically a narrowing of the air passage with further swelling and the production of extra mucus. This narrowing can be caused because of various reasons, including an allergic reaction or a genetic condition. Allergic reactions are triggered by environmental factors like pollution, harmful pollens, or some chemicals. Based on the causes, asthma is divided into three types: Seasonal asthma, Occupational asthma and Non-allergic asthma Symptoms like chest tightness, shortness of breath, coughing, and wheezing are the early signs of asthma. Asthma is diagnosed with lung tests and allergy tests. It is mainly diagnosed by Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) tests and spirometry test. Athma can be avoided by altering your lifestyle and being aware of your allergies. ', 'Y'),
(2, 'Abdominal airtic aneurysm', 'The main blood channel that travels from the heart through the abdomen and out to the rest of the lower body is called abdominal aorta. Abdominal aorta can enlarge and become aneurysmal. This condition is known as an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). The weakening of the aorta\'s wall causes the bulging or aneurysm. Smoking and high blood pressure are believed to increase the possibility of an aneurysm. Men over 65 are more likely to develop AAAs. In this age group, one death out of every fifty is caused by a rupture of abdominal aorta. Generally, AAA is asymptomatic and causes a slow death. But sometimes, when the aneurysm is too large, it results in pulsating feeling in abdomen and pain over lower back region. AAA can be diagnosed with the help of CT scan and MRI. Treatment of AAA involves surgery. Open abdomen surgery is widely prefered in AAA. ', ''),
(3, 'Acidity', 'Acidity is also known as acid reflux. It is characterized by heartburn that is felt in the lower chest region where the stomach belongs. Acidity is the condition in which stomach acid flows back up into the food pipe or esophagus and results in such symptoms. Acidity can be brought on by a variety of factors, including unhealthful eating patterns, high levels of stress, and the use of specific drugs. Moreover, lifestyle choices like smoking and eating foods high in oil, fat, and spices can increase your risk of acidity. Acidity can also result as stomach or esophageal disorder. Symptoms of acidity include burning sensation and pain in the throat and lower chest, difficulty swallowing food, frequent burping or hiccups, regurgitation (prolonged sour taste in the mouth) and nausea.

(48, 'Bullous pemphigoid', 'Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is a rare autoimmune disorder that affects the skin and mucous membranes. The condition occurs when the body\'s immune system mistakenly attacks proteins in the skin that help to bind the outer and inner layers of skin together. This leads to the formation of fluid-filled blisters or bullae on the skin that can be painful and itchy. BP can affect people of all ages, but is most common in older adults. Treatment typically involves topical or oral steroids to reduce inflammation and suppress the immune system. Other medications, such as immunosuppressants or biologic therapies, may also be used in more severe cases. Proper wound care and skin protection are also important components of managing BP.', 'Y'),
(49, 'Diabetes', 'Diabetes is a chronic condition characterized by high blood sugar levels. There are two main types of diabetes: type 1 diabetes, which results from the body\'s failure to produce insulin, and type 2 diabetes, which results from the body\'s inability to use insulin effectively. Insulin is a hormone that regulates blood sugar levels, and high blood sugar can cause a range of health complications, including heart disease, nerve damage, and kidney damage. Symptoms of diabetes may include increased thirst, frequent urination, blurred vision, and slow healing of wounds. Treatment for diabetes typically involves managing blood sugar levels through diet, exercise, and medications such as insulin or oral medications. Early diagnosis and management of diabetes are crucial to preventing or delaying the onset of complications.\n\n\n\n\n', 'Y'),

It is characterized by a loss of awareness, recurrent seizures, sensations, and sometimes a loss of awareness. A person who is having an episode of seizure exhibits strange behavior, symptoms, and sensations, sometimes even losing consciousness. It is a non-communicable disorder that makes a person paralyzed for the time being. Both physical issues (such as fractures and bruising from seizures-related traumas) and psychological issues, such as anxiety and sadness, are more common in people with epilepsy. There are many triggers to epilepsy, including genetics, poor immunity, infection, and even the side effects of medication.

It can cause mild to severe symptoms such as fever, cough, sore throat, runny nose, muscle and body aches, fatigue, and, in some cases, can lead to severe complications such as pneumonia. The flu is most common during the fall and winter months, but it can occur at any time of the year. The flu is typically spread through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes, but it can also be spread by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching the mouth, nose, or eyes. The best way to prevent the flu is to get a flu shot each year, as the vaccine is updated to protect against the most common strains of the virus. Other preventive measures include washing hands frequently, avoiding close contact with people who are sick, and staying home if you are feeling sick.', 'Y'),

It eventually affects a person\'s ability to perform everyday chores. Alzheimer\'s disease oftenly occurs in old age, but it is not a natural result of ageing and does not always develop in old age. As people age, their chances of developing Alzheimer\'s disease significantly rise. It is believed that the cause of Alzeheimer is a combination of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle variables, together with age-related brain changes. Memory loss or other symptoms of dementia can be caused by a variety of illnesses, some of which are treatable. Symptoms of Alzheimer\'s can get better or progress more slowly with medication. Consult your doctor for a comprehensive evaluation and diagnosis if you are worried about your memory or other thinking abilities.', 'Y'),

It occurs when body waste or stool goes through the digestive tract too slowly or cannot be efficiently removed from the body, which can result in the stool being hard and dry. There are numerous potential causes of chronic constipation. The majority of people have constipation at some point in their lives. Constipation is unpleasant, but it is typically seen as a symptom rather than an illness. Constipation can be caused by a variety of factors, such as an inadequate consumption of fiber-rich foods like junk foods, a lack of fluid consumption, an unhealthy sleep schedule, stress, or even as a side effect of taking certain medications. Laxative drugs are the medicines used to treat constipation.', 'Y'),

A waste product called uric acid can build up in the joints as urate crystals and cause insufferable pain. Along with intense pain, gout symptoms include swelling and redness in the joints. The joint at the base of the big toe is where gout occurs most frequently. Even a light touch to the swollen area becomes intolerable when a person has gout. The other common sites include the knee joint, wrist joint, and ankle joint. Gout frequently results in a scorching sensation and excruciating pain. It frequently necessitates an urgent trip to the hospital. However, gout can be managed painlessly if it is caught early enough and the uric acid levels are kept in check.', 'Y'),

(56, 'Jaundice', 'Jaundice is a disorder in which the skin, white areas of the eyes, and mucous membranes turn yellow in color. It is caused by the accumulation of bilirubin. Bilirubin is a waste product created during the typical breakdown of hemoglobin. It moves through the liver before ultimately being eliminated from the body. Inadequate elimination or increased production lead to excessive bilirubin. Some possible causes of jaundice include liver disease like cirrhosis or hepatitis, gallstones, alcohol consumption, gallbladder cancer, which is a disease that or other liver infections, and anemia. The normal blood levels of bilirubin are less than 1 mg/dl. When the bilirubin level increases above 3 mg/dl, it results in jaundice. As the serum bilirubin levels increase, the skin will progressively discolor, ranging from yellow to green. The green color is due to biliverdin, which is also a by-product of hemoglobin.', ''),

The attack of mosquitoes causes damage to the red blood cells, typically causing a high fever with chills and other symptoms that may develop into life-threatening complications. Hence, timely diagnosis and treatment of malaria are very crucial. When a person gets malaria, symptoms often start to appear 10–30 days after infection. The severity of the symptoms can vary depending on the parasite species. Some people experience no symptoms for up to a year following a mosquito bite. Sometimes parasites can remain dormant in the body for years without showing any signs. Malaria is typically diagnosed through blood tests. ', 'Y'),

A person could experience a sense of dizziness or the impression that everything around them is spinning. Vertigo can develop as a result of an inner ear disturbance or from other balance-impairing head and neck problems. The inner ear plays an important role in balancing the head in its position by maintaining pressure on both sides. There are two types of vertigo: peripheral and central. Peripheral vertigo is caused by problems in the inner ear. Central vertigo is caused by a brain or vestibulocochlear nerve defect. These vertigo attacks are frequently brief and don\'t need any medical attention because they go away on their own.

It is caused by changes in the ATP7B gene present on chromosome 13, which produces a protein called copper transporting protein. This protein is crucial for moving copper from the liver to the rest of the body. It also aids in the body\'s removal of extra copper. Wilson\'s illness most frequently manifests as liver disease. Symptoms also include tremor, muscle stiffness, drooling, trouble speaking, poor motor coordination, abrupt personality changes, neurosis, and psychosis, which are caused by nervous system involvement or mental alterations. The patient\'s body accumulates toxic quantities of copper, particularly in the liver and brain, which increases your risk of organ damage. Your mood will be impacted by elevated copper levels, which frequently leave you feeling weak, uncomfortable, and in pain.

Dengue fever is typically a moderate illness that can be treated at home by maintaining fluid intake, keeping an eye on symptoms, and using medications. But occasionally, it could result in a potentially harmful complication known as severe dengue (hemorrhage and shock). Severe dengue can cause bleeding, excruciating abdominal pain, and difficulty breathing. Dengue hemorrhagic fever is thought to be more likely to infect people with weak immune systems, as well as those who have experienced a second or subsequent dengue infection.', ''),
(66, 'Ascitis', 'Ascitis is an abnormal accumulation of fluid inside the cavities of the abdomen. The illness is secondary to liver cirrhosis, which is primarily brought on by consuming large amounts of alcohol. Ascitis is also seen in advanced stages of cancer and recurring malignancies, infections, clotting in blood vessels, low protein levels, and dialysis. Depending on the cause of the ascites, symptoms may appear gradually or quickly. The earliest sign of ascites is swelling of the abdomen, bloating, and pain in the swollen region. Breathlessness can result from large fluid accumulations because the fluid presses up on the diaphragm, which in turn compresses the lower lungs. If there is only a small amount of fluid in the belly, one might not experience any symptoms. The doctor suggests ultrasound, urine analysis, and liver function tests to confirm the diagnosis of ascitis. Acitis can be prevented by avoiding alcohol and limiting salt intake in the daily diet.', ''),

Bronchitis is generally caused by a bacterial or viral infection. Other causes of bronchitis include an allergic reaction to smoke or another irritant or allergen. Bronchitis can be of two types: acute and chronic. Acute bronchitis is a minor illness, like the seasonal virus flu associated with allergies. Chronic bronchitis is a severe form of bronchitis and is associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The frequent causes of chronic bronchitis are smoking and prolonged exposure to air pollution. Bronchitis can create further complications due to a weak immune system in the patient. Bronchitis patients are usually given antiviral and anti-inflammatory medicines.', 'Y'),

It is often a mild, self-limiting illness, but in infants or people with weakened immune systems, it can cause serious health problems. Symptoms of chickenpox are typical: extremely itchy rashes, flu, loss of appetite, headache, and chills. Home remedies and at-home care choices can help to reduce the discomfort and itching of chickenpox, even though the symptoms progress at their own pace. Once the chickenpox rash appears, it goes through three phases. Raised red bumps known as papules, which stay over for several days. The second phase is small, fluid-filled blisters, which form in about one day and then break and leak pus. The third phase is about crusts and scabs, which cover the broken blisters and take several more days to heal. These rashes and symptoms of chickenpox last for 10–15 days and gradually heal themselves.', 'Y'),

(76, 'Osteoporosis', 'Osteoporosis means porous bone. Bone fragility and fracture risk are increased by this disorder. Osteoporosis is known as the \"silent disease of the bones\" since patients don\'t experience any symptoms until a bone fracture occurs. These spontaneous fractures may result in severe back discomfort, height loss, or spinal deformities such as kyphosis (hunched posture). Osteoporosis is frequently encountered in elderly women, mainly due to menopause. An elderly woman lacks estrogen, a hormone responsible for female reproduction. Estrogen also helps to maintain bone density, and the lack of the hormone after menopause makes the bones fragile and prone to fractures. Other important risk factors include family history, inactivity, a lack of calcium and vitamin D, smoking, binge drinking, and low body weight. X-rays are used to diagnose osteoporosis.

(52, 17, 'Why diagnosis of Appendicitis is difficult?', '<p>A. Diagnosis of appendicitis is difficult since the position of the appendix in the abdomen may vary. The location of the appendix is at the lower right side of the abdomen most of the time. Appendix gets attached to the other structures in the abdomen through a sheet-like membrane structure called the mesentery. A larger mesentery allows the appendix to move around and as a result of this, the appendix keeps moving down to the other organs such as the pelvis and colon. Hence, inflammation of the appendix looks like the inflammation of other organs. Diagnosis of appendicitis can also be hard to identify when inflammatory problems look similar to it. Right-side diverticulitis is an example of it. Hence patients with the possibility of appendicitis are kept under observation to know the difference between appendicitis and other conditions.</p>', '2022-12-15 09:14:17'),

There are chances of inflammation of this remaining piece of the appendix and it can lead to further complications of appendicitis. Hence, it is possible to observe the recurrence of appendicitis in the case of patients who have previously undergone appendicitis surgery. Stump appendicitis is an acute inflammation of the residual appendix which mostly occurs after laparoscopic appendectomy. It results from obstruction of the lumen of the appendix which is left behind post-surgery in some cases.

(25, 'What is pathology Report', '<h4>What is a pathology report?</h4><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">A pathology report is a written medical record of a tissue diagnosis. A tissue diagnosis is the diagnosis made when a piece of tissue is examined by a pathologist, a doctor who is trained to examine tissue. He or she interprets the findings in tissue and makes a diagnosis. More than anything else, the pathology report dictates the management of a cancer and greatly impacts the management of other diseases.</p><h4>Who is a pathologist?</h4><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">A pathologist is a medical doctor who trains at least four years after graduating from medical school in how to examine tissue and make tissue diagnoses. Most pathologists train more than four years and specialize in making diagnoses in different areas of human disease. For instance, breast tissue may be examined by a pathologist specializing in surgical pathology and breast pathology.</p><h4>What kinds of tissue do pathologists examine?</h4><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">Pathologists are trained to examine tissue that may be as small as a dozen cells. Usually tissue is removed by a surgeon, a radiologist or another physician and sent to pathology for examination. Tissue can be cells taken by fine needle aspiration, a small core needle biopsy, a larger piece of tissue that is meant to remove a lesion or a very large piece of tissue that is a whole organ such as a whole breast or a lung.</p><h4>How do pathologists examine tissue?</h4><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">Pathologists examine tissue at two levels. First, the pathologist examines the tissue with his/her eyes and fingers to find abnormalities. If the piece of tissue is large, the pathologist will cut it into many slices so s/he can find small lesions that may be hidden in the tissue. The pathologist looks and feels for parts of the tissue that are abnormal. She or he looks at the location of the abnormalities and how far a lesion is from the edges of the tissue specimen. The edges are called \"margins\". For very small tissue samples, all of the tissue is processed to make microscopic slides. For larger tissue samples, the pathologist selects the parts of the tissue that looks and/or feels abnormal as well as some of the normal tissue for processing to make microscopic slides. Most of the time, the pathologist can make a diagnosis based on this first level of tissue examination. However, the pathologist confirms a diagnosis by examining sections under a microscope to make a final or microscopic diagnosis.</p><h4>What are the types of tissue that pathologists examine?</h4><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">Tissue removed for pathologic diagnosis fall into two general categories: Tissue that is removed to make a diagnosis but not to treat a lesion is called a biopsy. Biopsies can be very small pieces of tissue such as those obtained with a needle or they can be larger with stitches needed to close the hole left from removing the tissue. Tissue removed to treat a lesion is called a resection. Usually resections are large pieces of tissue, sometimes a whole body part such as a stomach, large bowel or a breast. Sometimes a piece of tissue is removed both to make a diagnosis and to treat the lesion. A breast lumpectomy may both remove and diagnose a lesion causing a mass.</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p>', '992', NULL, '98', '9'),
